# flagcounter

This is a simple flag counter thingy I made by reusing code my guestbook, I have also merged some code from [moe-counter](https://github.com/journey-ad/Moe-Counter) and added it in this repository because they way moe-counter works is simple +1 each request instead of saving IPs and counting unique requests.
